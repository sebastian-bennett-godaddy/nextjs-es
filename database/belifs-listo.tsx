The Buddha, delighted by their offer, gifted them exactly eight of his hairs, which the brothers then carried in a ruby casket to what is now Myanmar. From there, the King of Yangon commissioned the construction of the gold-plated and gemstone-encrusted temple where the holy hairs would eventually be entombed. The pagoda has survived several natural disasters and military occupations, and the glittering sight still stands as a reminder of hope and resilience.",

The four colossal figures seated at the entrance of this sandstone structure represent Ramesses with an etched image of Re-Horakhty above the doorway. Some scholars believe the temples date back to 1264 BCE after the pharaoh’s victory at the Battle Kadesh, while others believe it came about later in 1244 BCE after the Nubian Campaigns of Ramesses and his sons. In the 1960s, the temples had to be moved and rebuilt onto a higher point atop the cliff after fears that the newly built Aswan High Dam on the Nile would submerge the sacred sites underwater.",

The structure faced destruction by Persian armies during the battle of Plataea in 479 BCE. The Greeks swore never to rebuild this or any other damaged holy site, and they chose to leave them in ruins as a reminder of the war. Some scholars argue that the temple may actually honor the Athenian hero Theseus, whose remains are believed to be housed inside. However, the idea is often refuted, as many of the temple’s inscriptions are associated with Hephaestus.",

        description: "One of the most unique cathedrals in the world, Cathedral of Brasília resembles a hyperbolic crown in the middle of Brasília's Monumental Axis. Renowned Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer worked closely with urban planner Lúcio Costa to design the 16 boomerang-shaped columns to curve towards the sky as a gesture of communication. The impressive stained glass by French-Brazilian artist Marianne Peretti adds subtle color to the cathedral while allowing for natural light to flood the sanctuary."

The striking Anglican cathedral was built in the neo-Gothic style with elaborate stained-glass windows decorating the apse. The brilliant white finish is said to have come from Madras chunam, a plaster made of egg whites, shell lime, and sugar. However, preservationists have begun to question whether the plasterwork was used within the cathedral as they can not find traces of it on the walls."
